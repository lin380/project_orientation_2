## Instructions

### Setup

1. Create a new R Markdown document. Title it "Project: Orientation #2" and provide add your name as the author. 
2. Delete all the material below the front matter
3. Add your Zotero API key to this RStudio Cloud project through the Tools > Global Options... > R Markdown > Citations menu.

### Project

**Identifying aim(s) and finding(s)**

1. Search scholarly articles on a topic and/ or area of potential interest to you. You can use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or WFU ZSR Library's [Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts (LLBA) interface](http://zsr.wfu.edu/databases/purl/28783) as your search engine. Be sure to include 'corpus analysis' or 'corpus study' as part of your search criteria to help identify research which will be more directly relevant to the methods in this course.

2. Identify at least one article which you find particularly interesting. (Note: you are not committing yourself to this article or this topic/ area.) 

3. Find the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for the article(s) and enter this/these DOI(s) in Zotero to import the citation information. Download the PDF version of this/these article(s) and attach it/them to the reference(s) in Zotero.

4. Skim the article(s) for: (1) the aim(s) of the study(ies) and (2) the main finding(s) of the study(ies).

5. In the R Markdown document, cite and in your own words summarize the points in (4) for the article(s).

6. Format your interest statement using Markdown syntax as needed.
